KNOWN BUGS IN CXXWRAP
Send bug reports to deaven@execpc.com

parser/database:
    - there are reduce/reduce conflicts in the grammer
    - inline class/structure definitions do not yield valid
      type definitions.

JNI code generation:
    - typedefs are not followed
    - template instantiation does not compound C types, it kludges
      by ORing modifier bits in a flat structure.
    - if methods are overloaded, only the first is wrapped, even
      if the wrapped signatures would be different (and so could
      produce legal overloaded java methods).
    - JNI code generated from namespaced code is susceptible to
      name collisions.

HTML page generation:
    - Using the javadoc {@link class#method (<signature detail>)}
      does not work if the signature detail is specified.
    - CSS not used

Manual page generation (need to be re-done similar to HTML):
    - The <p> directives, other HTML bits are not stripped in the
      manual pages, let alone processed.
