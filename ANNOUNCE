Free C++/Java development software announcement:

    I have recently released a new version of "cxxwrap", which is free
    software for automatically wrapping C++ interfaces in Java JNI,
    and for producing javadoc-style HTML documentation of the C++
    interface (even parts that do not translate to java).  Welcome
    aboard anybody who had to, or has yet to, solve this same tedious
    "where's the high-performance java interface" problem for a large
    legacy C++ code base.

What is cxxwrap?

    - An automatic java wrapper for C++ classes, which produces
      java language bindings using Sun's JNI (Java Native
      Interface).
 
    - Yet another HTML C++ documentation generator.  cxxwrap 
      produces output very similar to the Java Development Kit 
      javadoc in 1.2 (and the HTML pages are very fast to load,
      they contain no excessive graphics or javascript, etc.) 
      The class and method documentation is also kept in the java
      language binding, so you can run javadoc on the java API as
      well.

    - Unix manual page generator.  Class documentation can be written
      in troff form suitable for use with man(1).
