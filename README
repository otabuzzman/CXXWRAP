cxxwrap is a program to wrap C++ libraries in Java, as well as
document the libraries using javadoc conventions.

COMPILING

    Unix (all flavors)
	Try "./configure", followed by "make".  This should build
	the executable "cxxwrap" amd the compiled man page "cxxwrap.1".

    Windows 95/98/NT
	If you have cygnus (http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32),
	use bash and follow the unix directions above.  Otherwise,
	under visual C++ the subdirectory "win32" contains a makefile
	compatible with the "nmake" command.  Just type "nmake" in
	the win32 directory to build cxxwrap.exe (the man page is
	not built when you use this method).

USAGE

    Run "cxxwrap --help" to see a complete list of options.  The
    shell script "run-test" included with this distribution runs
    cxxwrap on a sample header file, puts HTML and manual pages in
    the examples/ subdirectory, puts a JNI wrapper in the examples
    subdirectory, compiles the JNI wrapper, and runs it.  You may
    need to edit the run-test script to uncomment the correct
    settings for your OS.

DOCUMENTATION

    Read the manual page after building ("more cxxwrap.1").
    Point your HTML browser at "doc/index.html".

BUG REPORTS

    Send bug reports, fixes, and feature requests to deaven@deaven.net,
    after checking the BUGS file for existing bug reports and the
    TODO file for existing feature requests.

    Enjoy!
