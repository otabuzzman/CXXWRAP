List of things I'd like to implement in cxxwrap but have
not gotten around to yet.  Send change requests or fixes
to deaven@execpc.com.

parser

    save CTEXT from parser and be able to reproduce headers,
    filtering out deprecated apis.

    parse IDL class descriptions

html

    use stylesheets, more like javadoc

    add deprecated API list, like javadoc

jni

    add a way to make JNI native libs loaded in "static" code section
    of each class, without enforcing a policy on naming of jni libs.

    correct relative URLs in java comments, so that diagrams or other
    references can work in C++ and java API pages.

    do more to resolve conflicts between methods overriding those of
    java.lang.Object.

    add memory management API for tieing delete() to finalize().

    wrap C functions into a single class with static methods

other

    add a "style-checker" module to help enforce API policies
