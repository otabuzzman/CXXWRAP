<h2>
<a name="introduction"></a>Introduction: what is cxxwrap?</h2>
cxxwrap is a software engineering tool which scans C++ header files
defining
a set&nbsp; of classes.&nbsp; Once the class interface definitions have
been scanned, cxxwrap can
<ul>
  <li>
Document the interface(s) using HTML, in a style similar to that of
Sun's
javadoc,</li>
  <li>
Document the interface(s) using Unix manual pages,</li>
  <li>
Wrap the interface(s) in Java using JNI,</li>
  <li>
Describe the class and package dependencies of the interface(s), and</li>
  <li>
Analyze the interface(s) to compute statistical data about the API.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="jni code generation"></a>JNI code generation</h2>
The primary reason cxxwrap was written is to generate JNI code to bind
a Java API to one or more C++ libraries.
<h3><a name="general"></a>General line of attack</h3>
All java objects are "pointers", in the C++ sense.&nbsp; (For example,
the assignment operator in Java is defined to be a pointer copy.)&nbsp;
The diagram below shows how cxxwrap keeps a Java object tied to a C++
implementation.&nbsp;
Invocations of methods on the object are decoded by JNI C++ code, and
result
in invocations on the C++ object implementation.
<blockquote><tt>MyObject jA = new MyObject(); // invokes C++ constructor</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>jA.foo(37);</tt></blockquote>
<img alt="JNI connection in cxxwrap" src="jni1.gif" nosave=""
 style="width: 607px; height: 285px;">
<br>
Note that if some Java code copies an object with the assignment
operator,&nbsp;
both the original and new object pointers are tied to a single instance
of the C++ implementation:
<blockquote><tt>MyObject jB = jA; // does not invoke C++ constructor</tt></blockquote>
<img alt="Pointers in cxxwrap" src="jni1_1.gif" nosave=""
 style="width: 553px; height: 232px;">
<br>
If the wrapped API provides another way to access a refererence to
the C++ object, one can also end up with two separate Java objects,
each
of which refers to the <i>same</i> C++ object.&nbsp; This is a
fundamendally
different case than the last example:
<blockquote><tt>MyObject jA = someObject.getContainedA();</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>MyObject jB = anotherObject.getContainedA();</tt></blockquote>
<img alt="Duplicate pointers in cxxwrap" src="jni4.gif" nosave=""
 style="width: 607px; height: 441px;">
<br>
In the diagram above, both jA and jB refer to the same object, but
Java doesn't know this.&nbsp; It should now be obvious that dealing
with
garbage collection is going more difficult in a wrapped Java API (more
about that <a href="#final">later</a>.)
<h3><a name="argument conversion"></a>Argument conversion</h3>
The story gets a bit trickier in the case of non-primitive method
arguments.&nbsp;
In this case, the JNI code layer must do more work, using Sun's JNI
interface
APIs to gain access to a suitable representation of the JVM's internal
data:
<blockquote><tt>jA.foo(new int[3] {1, 2, 3});</tt></blockquote>
<img alt="Argument conversion in cxxwrap" src="jni2.gif" nosave=""
 style="width: 607px; height: 285px;">
<br>
(The JNI code shown above is schematic.&nbsp; Refer to the Sun API
to see the real names of the JNI interface methods used to convert
data.)
<p>One important point to make is that during the course of the method
invocation, a temporary copy of the entire array may be made, which is
then destroyed prior to the method return.&nbsp; So, data pointers <i>cannot
be transported across the Java/C++ boundary.</i>&nbsp; This is a severe
and fundamental limitation with the JNI interface (<a href="#footnote">*</a>).&nbsp;
Applications must be sure not to rely on the contents of array
arguments
after invocation of one of the cxxwrap JNI methods.
</p>
<p>cxxwrap can use this method to convert all arrays of primitives, as
well as the java.lang.String primitive type, which becomes a C++
"char*".&nbsp;
The complete list of type mappings from C++ to Java implemented by
cxxwrap
is as follows:

<h3>
<a name="final"></a>Finalization and destruction</h3>
When a Java object is deleted (by the JVM, which will also invoke the
object's
finalize() method), the C++ implementation underneath could also be
deleted...
right?&nbsp; No, because there may be other C++ objects in the system,
hidden from the JVM, which are holding and using pointers to the C++
implementation.&nbsp;
We saw before that this can happen even on the Java side, if multiple
references
to the same underlying C++ object are obtained using the wrapped
API.&nbsp;
(There are other approaches to wrapping interfaces in Java which can
co-exisit
peacefully with garbage collection, but they incur a heavy performance
price, such as maintainence of a large object mapping table.)
<p>cxxwrap provides an explicit method on all Java objects called
delete(),
which invokes the C++ destructor.&nbsp; Applications should use
delete()
just as they would in C++, following the analogy that all Java objects
are pointers.&nbsp; If a wrapped Java object fails to call delete(), a
memory leak can occur on the C++ heap.
</p>
<blockquote><tt>jA.delete(); // invokes C++ destructor</tt></blockquote>
<img alt="Destructors in cxxwrap" src="jni3.gif" nosave=""
 style="width: 607px; height: 285px;">
<h3><a name="extending in java"></a>Extending classes in java</h3>
One consequence of the approach cxxwrap uses to implement java wrappers
is that the resilting java classes cannot be extended, in general, by
deriving
new subclasses in java.&nbsp; That's because when the C++
implementation
invokes a method from the object's virtual table, it's always the C++
method,
never the new java method, which gets invoked.&nbsp; For example, lets
say you have the following cxxwrapped class interface:
<blockquote><tt>public class A {</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public A();</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void foo();</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>}</tt></blockquote>
and you then derive a new class in java:
<blockquote><tt>public class B extends A {</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void foo() { System.out.println("B
foo!");
}</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>}</tt></blockquote>
You can then create an object of class B and pass it, as an A, to some
C++ wrapped API.&nbsp; But when C++ invokes the foo() method on your
object,
only A's foo() gets called -- never B's foo() -- because the C++
virtual
table cannot contain a pointer to the java version of foo() in class B.
<p>cxxwrap allows you to extend abstract classes in java, for any pure
virtual method.&nbsp; If you define A as follows in C++:
</p>
<blockquote><tt>class A {</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>public:</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A();</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A(int bar);</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual void foo() = 0;</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>};</tt></blockquote>
then cxxwrap will generate constructors for class A in java, which
yield
java objects whose pure virtual methods can be extended.&nbsp; Now,
when
you write class B as shown above, the java version of foo() will be
invoked
whenever C++ invokes foo().&nbsp; This is accomplished by generating a
hidden adapter class in C++ for every abstract class.&nbsp; It is the
hidden
adapter whch gets constructed by class A's constructors, not a C++
class
A directly.
<p>If your native code creates native threads (e.g pthreads) which are
compatible with the JVM you run in, these threads can invoke Java
virtual
methods via a cxxwrap API.&nbsp; When a Java method is invoked in
cxxwrap-generated
C++ code, the JNI thread attach API is used to ensure that the calling
thread is known to the JVM.
</p>
<h3><a name="adding"></a>Adding on to an already wrapped API</h3>
Let's say you are given a cxxwrap JNI interface to a set of C++
classes,
for which you also have the C++ header files (let's say "<tt>vendor/*.h</tt>".&nbsp;
You'd like to add some more classes from your own package, whose C++
header
files are in "<tt>local/*.h</tt>".&nbsp; Here's how to invoke cxxwrap
to
do so:
<blockquote><tt>cxxwrap --jni --jni-packages=local vendor/*.h local/*.h</tt></blockquote>
The "--jni-packages" argument tells cxxwrap to emit JNI interfaces only
for your files.&nbsp; cxxwrap still needs to scan the vendor files, to
build up its internal database of objects in the vendor package(s).
<p>A more compact and reliable way to accomplish this is to use the
"--write-cache"
and "--read-cache" options of cxxwrap.&nbsp; The following example is
taken
from the regression test for cxxwrap:
</p>
<p>First, the base library is wrapped:
</p>
<blockquote><tt>cxxwrap --verbose --package-prefix=org.part1 --jni \</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --write-cache=examples/part1.cache
examples/part1.h</tt></blockquote>
Here, the classes found in "examples/part1.h" will be assigned to the
package
"org.part1.examples", and all classes and template definotions will be
saved in "examples/part1.cache" for later use.&nbsp; Next, the add-on
library
which depends on classes in "examples/part1.h" is wrapped:
<blockquote><tt>./cxxwrap --verbose --package-prefix=org.part2 --jni \</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --read-cache=examples/part1.cache
examples/part2.h</tt></blockquote>
Here, the new classes defined in "examples/part2.h" are assigned to the
"org.part2.examples" package, but they can still refer to classes from
the first wrapping session. No "--jni-packages" option is needed,
because
cxxwrap marks classes read from a cache as already wrapped and will not
wrap them again.
<p>This pattern can be extended to an arbitrary number of dependent
libraries,
by using more than one "--read-cache: option on the later wrapping
sessions.
</p>
<p></p>
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="footnote"></a>*This limitation may be intentional on Sun's
part as a part of a deliberate business strategy.&nbsp; If only JVM
developers
can implement high-performance native code under a Java API, then they
gain a significant strategic advantage in implementing advanced media
APIs
which require data transport from Java to C++.
